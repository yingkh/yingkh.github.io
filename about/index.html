<h2>Hello! I am Ka Ho</h2>
  <p>
    I am a specialist in Data Science, accquiring knowledge in Machine Learning, Statistics and Mathematics during
    my undergraduate studies. My specialisation is based on my fundemental strength in Mathematics, Programming and Computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was a Software Engineer (or more formally a Software Solutions Engineer) for at least four (4) years upon
    the completion of System Analysis course in year 2012. A key project I undertook as a Software Engineer is the build a data warehouse
    system that does web scrapping for data to be analysed.

  <p>
    Thoughout my profession, I value the most fundemental thing mentioned in Agile Manifesto, that is,
    to find better ways to develop better software (or solutions/products) and teaching people how to do it.
  </p>
  <h4>A little trivia...</h4>
  <p>
    When doing webscrapping in Python, I chose to use CSS selector in developing webscrapping script, just I have use them
    in jQuery and webscrapping in the .NET platform.

  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p>
    This website is a github page that is build using Jekyll. While it's easy to duplicate the themes from the Jekyll theme repository,
    I have decided to build the pages with just mainly HTML and CSS. Please do take note that this website is best viewed with the most up-to-date desktop
    browser that supports HTML5 and CSS3 as this website contains the latest feature that are not supported by older browser.
