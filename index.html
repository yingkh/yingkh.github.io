   <h2><a href="/character-recognition/">The Case of Trying to Recognise Characters From Colour Images</a></h2>
   <p>
     In my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive, I tried to build a model for recognition of English letters and
     numerical digits with computer generated characters based on a variety of fonts, but the accuracy of the test was about
     40 percent, way below 90 percent accuracy on training set. Does it mean that the model was overfitted?
